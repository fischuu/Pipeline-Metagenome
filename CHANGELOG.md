### Development version 0.3.*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29: Added sed command to remove comment lines from the prodigal gene prediction

28: Added the k-min option for megahit to avoid crashes in case of deep sequenced genomes

27: Adjusted the output paths for the MAG module

26: Fixed a bug in the EGGNOG annotation step, that prevented the annotation to happen...

25: Added the concoct steps for the co-assemblies

24: Some concoct intermediate files are set to temp now

23: Concoct module  for the full assembly finalised

22: Added the --cluster-cancel option to the start script

21: Added the filtered assemblies to the QUAST report

20: Added a length filter for the metagenome assemblies

19: Constrained the cagroup wildcard

18: Report reads per contig for full and coas

17: Added alignment statistics to the quantification

16: Quantification step added

15: Eggnog annotation added

14: Prodigal gene prediction added

13: Samples can now be used in several co-assemblies, separated by comma in samplesheet file

12: Server resource allocation names adjusted

11: Bowtie2 indices are now forced to be large to avoid index naming issues

10: Added rules to align reads against the various assemblies (full and co-assemblies)

9: Metaquast added to the pipeline

8: Group-wise co-assemblies are now also generated

7: Added the QC (FastQC and MultiQC) for the Raw samples and concatenated as well as trimmed ones

6: Example start and config files copy+paste error fixed

5: More adjustments to the default resource allocations (extract_fasta_concoct_1k and extract_fasta_concoct_2k)

4: MEGAHIT_temp folder is now temporary only, to save tons of disc space

3: Adjusted the defaults resources for concoct parts 1k and 2k

2: Critical bugfix, 2k concoct calculations were done with 1k output
